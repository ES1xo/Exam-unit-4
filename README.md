**Exam module 4**

In this module we have done coding for our project with a microcontroller to create a Fitness game using different lights and buttons. It took us a while to come up with the code that got the buttons to light up and respond to the button presses, so they could alternately switch when triggered. We initially planned to have 4 buttons working with a randomized patterns, but could not get this working in time as 2 of the buttons were not completely functional and we already struggled to get the code and microcontroller working together enough so that we could the lights and dbuttons to respond to our code. For the reading and logging code, we implemented a simple code to log button presses, and he time of the buttons being pressed, but we also intended on logging more data like rounds and lap times, however we did not get this implemented in time. In the individual part I implemented reading of these data points in the CLI App as this is hopefully we will be able to do in the future.
